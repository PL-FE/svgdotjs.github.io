# RBox

## rbox()

`returns` __`SVG.RBox`__

Is similar to `bbox()` but will give you the box around the exact visual representation of the element, taking all transformations into account.

```javascript
path.rbox()
```

This will return an instance of `SVG.RBox` containing the following values:

- `width` (the actual visual width)
- `height` (the actual visual height)
- `w` (shorthand for `width`)
- `h` (shorthand for `height`)
- `x` (the actual visual position on the x-axis)
- `y` (the actual visual position on the y-axis)
- `cx` (center `x` of the bounding box)
- `cy` (center `y` of the bounding box)
- `x2` (lower right `x` of the bounding box)
- `y2` (lower right `y` of the bounding box)

__Important__: Mozilla browsers include stroke widths where other browsers do not. Therefore the resulting box might be different in Mozilla browsers. It is very hard to modify this behavior so for the time being this is an inconvenience we have to live with.
