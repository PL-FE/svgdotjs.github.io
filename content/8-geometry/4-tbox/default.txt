# TBox

## tbox()

`returns` __`SVG.TBox`__

Where `bbox()` returns a bounding box mindless of any transformations, the `tbox()` method does take transformations into account. So any translation or scale will be applied to the resulting values to get closer to the actual visual representation:

```javascript
path.tbox()
```

This will return an instance of `SVG.TBox` containing the following values:

- `width` (value from native getBBox influenced by the `scaleX` of the current matrix)
- `height` (value from native getBBox influenced by the `scaleY` of the current matrix)
- `w` (shorthand for `width`)
- `h` (shorthand for `height`)
- `x` (value from native getBBox influenced by the `x` of the current matrix)
- `y` (value from native getBBox influenced by the `y` of the current matrix)
- `cx` (center `x` of the bounding box)
- `cy` (center `y` of the bounding box)
- `x2` (lower right `x` of the bounding box)
- `y2` (lower right `y` of the bounding box)

Note that the rotation of the element will not be added to the calculation.
