# ViewBox

## viewbox() _as getter_

`returns` __`SVG.ViewBox`__

Without any arguments an instance of `SVG.ViewBox` will be returned:

```javascript
var box = draw.viewbox()
```

But the best thing about the `viewbox()` method is that you can get the zoom of the viewbox:

```javascript
var box = draw.viewbox()
var zoom = box.zoom
```

If the size of the viewbox equals the size of the svg drawing, the zoom value will be 1.

## viewbox() _as setter_

`returns` __`itself`__

The `viewBox` attribute of an `<svg>` element can be managed with the `viewbox()` method. When supplied with four arguments it will act as a setter:

```javascript
draw.viewbox(0, 0, 297, 210)
```

Alternatively you can also supply an object as the first argument:

```javascript
draw.viewbox({ x: 0, y: 0, width: 297, height: 210 })
```
