`returns` __`itself`__

Events can be bound to elements as follows:

```javascript
rect.click(function() {
  this.fill({ color: '#f06' })
})
```

Removing it is quite as easy:

```javascript
rect.click(null)
```

All available events are: `click`, `dblclick`, `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mousemove`, `touchstart`, `touchmove`, `touchleave`, `touchend` and `touchcancel`.

Description: All available events are click, dblclick, mousedown, mouseup, mouseover, mouseout, mousemove, touchstart, touchmove, touchleave, touchend and touchcancel.
