Title: Memory

Description: Storing data in-memory is very much like setting attributes. Multiple values can also be remembered at once.

# Memory

## remember() _as getter_

`returns` __`value`__

To retrieve a memory

```javascript
rect.remember('oldBBox')
```

## remember() _as setter_

`returns` __`itself`__

Storing data in-memory is very much like setting attributes:

```javascript
rect.remember('oldBBox', rect.bbox())
```

Multiple values can also be remembered at once:

```javascript
rect.remember({
  oldFill:    rect.attr('fill')
, oldStroke:  rect.attr('stroke')
})
```

## forget()

`returns` __`itself`__

Erasing a single memory:

```javascript
rect.forget('oldBBox')
```

Or erasing multiple memories at once:


```javascript
rect.forget('oldFill', 'oldStroke')
```

And finally, just erasing the whole memory:

```javascript
rect.forget()
```
