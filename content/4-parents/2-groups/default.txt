# Groups

`returns` __`SVG.G`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Container`__

Grouping elements is useful if you want to transform a set of elements as if it were one. All element within a group maintain their position relative to the group they belong to. A group has all the same element methods as the root svg document:

```javascript
var group = draw.group()
group.path('M10,20L30,40')
```

Existing elements from the svg document can also be added to a group:

```javascript
group.add(rect)
```

__Note:__ Groups do not have a geometry of their own, it's inherited from their content. Therefore groups do not listen to `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` attributes. If that is what you are looking for, use a `nested()` svg instead.
