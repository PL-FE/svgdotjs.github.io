# Parents

The `SVG.Parent` prototype is the base wrapper for all elements that can contain other elements. `SVG.Parent` inherits directly from the lowest level of all SVG.js prototypes: `SVG.Element`.

`SVG.Container` adds another level to the parent inheritance stack. Where `SVG.Parent` brings some low level methods like `add()`, `remove()` and `has()` to name a few, `SVG.Container` can and should be used if you want to add your own methods. That way the `SVG.Parent` prototype remains clean. Therefore you should always inherit from `SVG.Container` when implementing your own parent elements.

The parent inheritance stack is: `SVG.Element` > `SVG.Parent` > `SVG.Container`.

# Main svg document

`returns` __`SVG.Doc`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Container`__

The main SVG.js initializer function creates a root svg node in the given element and returns an instance of `SVG.Doc`:

```javascript
var draw = SVG('drawing')
```

# Groups

`returns` __`SVG.G`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Container`__

Grouping elements is useful if you want to transform a set of elements as if it were one. All element within a group maintain their position relative to the group they belong to. A group has all the same element methods as the root svg document:

```javascript
var group = draw.group()
group.path('M10,20L30,40')
```

Existing elements from the svg document can also be added to a group:

```javascript
group.add(rect)
```

__Note:__ Groups do not have a geometry of their own, it's inherited from their content. Therefore groups do not listen to `x`, `y`, `width` and `height` attributes. If that is what you are looking for, use a `nested()` svg instead.

# Nested svg

`returns` __`SVG.Nested`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Container`__

With this feature you can nest svg documents within each other. Nested svg documents have exactly the same features as the main, top-level svg document:

```javascript
var nested = draw.nested()

var rect = nested.rect(200, 200)
```

# Defs

`returns` __`SVG.Defs`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Container`__

The `<defs>` element is a container element for referenced elements. Elements that are descendants of a ‘defs’ are not rendered directly. The `<defs>` node lives in the main `<svg>` document and can be accessed with the `defs()` method:

```javascript
var defs = draw.defs()
```

The defs are also available on any other element through the `doc()` method:

```javascript
var defs = rect.doc().defs()
```

The defs node works exactly the same as groups.

# Hyperlink

`returns` __`SVG.A`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Container`__

A hyperlink or `<a>` tag creates a container that enables a link on all children:

```javascript
var link = draw.link('http://svgdotjs.github.io/')
var rect = link.rect(100, 100)
```

The link url can be updated with the `to()` method:

```javascript
link.to('http://apple.com')
```

Furthermore, the link element has a `show()` method to create the `xlink:show` attribute:

```javascript
link.show('replace')
```

And the `target()` method to create the `target` attribute:

```javascript
link.target('_blank')
```

Elements can also be linked the other way around with the `linkTo()` method:

```javascript
rect.linkTo('http://svgdotjs.github.io/')
```

Alternatively a block can be passed instead of a url for more options on the link element:

```javascript
rect.linkTo(function(link) {
  link.to('http://svgdotjs.github.io/').target('_blank')
})
```
