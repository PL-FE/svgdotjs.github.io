Title: Defs

Text: 

# Defs

`returns` __`SVG.Defs`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Container`__

The `<defs>` element is a container element for referenced elements. Elements that are descendants of a ‘defs’ are not rendered directly. The `<defs>` node lives in the main `<svg>` document and can be accessed with the `defs()` method:

```javascript
var defs = draw.defs()
```

The defs are also available on any other element through the `doc()` method:

```javascript
var defs = rect.doc().defs()
```

The defs node works exactly the same as groups.
