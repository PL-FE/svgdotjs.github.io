Title: Animate

# Animate
Animating elements is very much the same as manipulating elements using the `attr()` method. The only difference is you have to include the `animate()` method.

## animate()

`returns` __`SVG.FX`__

```javascript
rect.animate().move(150, 150)
```

The `animate()` method will take three arguments. The first is `duration`, the second `ease` and the third `delay`:

```javascript
rect.animate(2000, '>', 1000).attr({ fill: '#f03' })
```

Alternatively you can pass an object as the first argument:

```javascript
rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' })
```

By default `duration` will be set to `1000`, `ease` will be set to `<>`.

You can chain multiple animations together by calling `animate` again:

```javascript
rect.animate({ ease: '<', delay: '1.5s' }).attr({ fill: '#f03' }).animate().dmove(50,50)
```
