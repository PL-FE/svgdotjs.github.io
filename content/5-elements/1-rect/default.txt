Title: Rect

----

Text: 

# Rect

`returns` __`SVG.Rect`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Shape`__

Rects have two arguments, their `width` and `height`:

```javascript
var rect = draw.rect(100, 100)
```

## radius()

`returns` __`itself`__<br>`animate` __`yes`__

Rects can also have rounded corners:

```javascript
rect.radius(10)
```

This will set the `rx` and `ry` attributes to `10`. To set `rx` and `ry` individually:

```javascript
rect.radius(10, 20)
```

Description: Rects have two arguments, their width and height. Rects can also have rounded corners with the rx and ry attributes.
