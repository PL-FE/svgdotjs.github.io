Title: Image

# Image

`returns` __`SVG.Image`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Shape`__

Creating images is as you might expect:

```javascript
var image = draw.image('/path/to/image.jpg')
```

If you know the size of the image, those parameters can be passed as the second and third arguments:

```javascript
var image = draw.image('/path/to/image.jpg', 200, 300)
```

## load()

`returns` __`itself`__

Loading another image can be done with the `load()` method:

```javascript
image.load('/path/to/another/image.jpg')
```

## loaded()

`returns` __`itself`__

If you don't know the size of the image, obviously you will have to wait for the image to be `loaded`:

```javascript
var image = draw.image('/path/to/image.jpg').loaded(function(loader) {
  this.size(loader.width, loader.height)
})
```

The returned `loader` object as first the argument of the loaded method contains four values:
- `width`
- `height`
- `ratio` (width / height)
- `url`
