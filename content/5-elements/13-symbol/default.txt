Title: Symbol

Text: 

# Symbol

`returns` __`SVG.Bare`__ ` which inherits from ` __`SVG.Element`__

Not unlike the `group` element, the `symbol` element is a container element. The only difference between symbols and groups is that symbols are not rendered. Therefore a `symbol` element is ideal in combination with the `use` element:

```javascript
var symbol = draw.symbol()
symbol.rect(100, 100).fill('#f09')

var use  = draw.use(symbol).move(200, 200)
```
