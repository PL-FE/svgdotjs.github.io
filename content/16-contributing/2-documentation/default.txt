# Documentation

The SVG.js docs are built upon (link: https://getkirby.com/ text: Kirby target: _blank) with the (link: https://natesteiner.com/kdoc text: KDoc theme target: _blank).

## Requirements
You'll need:
- PHP 5.4+
- Node.js

## Getting started
1. Download or clone the **(link: https://github.com/svgdotjs/svgdotjs.github.io text: svgdotjs.github.io target: _blank)** repo and switch to the `source` branch.

2. Run `npm install `. This is only required the first time.

3. Run `npm run serve -s` which will open up your default browser with the docs running.

## Writing
Log in to Kirby on (link: http://localhost:8008/panel target: _blank) using username **svgjs** and password **svgjs**.

The text editors in Kirby are (link: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax text: Markdown target: _blank) and (link: https://getkirby.com/docs/content/text text: Kirbytext target: _blank) enabled.

## Pull Requests
If you're not a core collaborator on (link: https://github.com/svgdotjs/ text: svgdotjs target: _blank), fork the (link: https://github.com/svgdotjs/svgdotjs.github.io/tree/source text: `source` branch target: _blank), make the required changes in Kirby following the same style as the rest of the docs, and create a PR. We will take care of the rest, so no need to build or include a static version.

## Building the static version

1. Go to (link: http://localhost:8008/statify.php target: _blank) in a web browser to run the build. The static files will be generated at `static` at the root of the repo.

2. Move the `static` folder out of the repo (e.g. your Desktop).

3. Commit and push the changes in the `source` branch and switch to the `master` branch.

4. Replace everything in the `master` branch with the contents of the `static` folder.

5. Commit and push the changes in the `master` branch and you're done!
