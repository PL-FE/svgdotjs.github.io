Title: PointArray

----

Text: 

# SVG.PointArray

`inherits from` __`SVG.Array`__

Is a bit more complex and is used for polyline and polygon elements. This is a poly-point string:

```javascript
'0,0 100,100'
```

The dynamic representation:

```javascript
[
  [0, 0]
, [100, 100]
]
```

Precompiling it as an `SVG.PointArray`:

```javascript
new SVG.PointArray([
  [0, 0]
, [100, 100]
])
```

Note that every instance of `SVG.Polyline` and `SVG.Polygon` carries a reference to the `SVG.PointArray` instance:

```javascript
polygon.array() //-> returns the SVG.PointArray instance
```
