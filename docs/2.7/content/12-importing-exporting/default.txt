Title: Importing / Exporting

# Import / export SVG

## svg() _as getter_

`returns` __`string`__

Exporting the full generated SVG, or a part of it, can be done with the `svg()` method:

```javascript
draw.svg()
```

Exporting works on individual elements as well:

```javascript
var rect = draw.rect()
var svg  = rect.svg()
```

## svg() _as setter_

`returns` __`itself`__

Importing is done with the same method by passing a string of svg as the first argument:

```javascript
draw.svg('<g><rect width="100" height="50" fill="#f06"></rect></g>')
```

Importing works on any element that inherits from `SVG.Parent`, which is basically every element that can contain other elements.
